# cem400h-pals
the is a place to keep my Python codes for MSU Radiation Chemistry Pals project
These codes are used to calculate the origin based on the energy and the three coordinates of the y-rays on the detector.
These models include a built-in self-checking system, which could generate correct and no "noise" data.
